Task-2
In this version of Task 2, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using a modular, function-driven approach for better code organization and reusability. I used Pandas for data handling, Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualization, and Plotly for optional enhancements. The analysis began with a general data inspection, followed by visual exploration using histograms and boxplots to understand distributions and detect outliers. I examined relationships between features through pairplots and a correlation heatmap. I also analyzed survival patterns based on gender and passenger class. Each task—whether checking skewness or exploring feature trends—was encapsulated in a function to keep the workflow clean and maintainable. The final dataset was saved for further use, and the structure allows easy extension for future modeling or insights.
